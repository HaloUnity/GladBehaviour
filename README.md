##Features

Current Features:
* Draws interface fields to the inspector
* Draws collections of interface fields to the inspector

##How to Use

Build the VS solution, import the built DLLs, mark the xxx.Editor.dll file as an editor only file and then inherit from GladMonoBehaviour instead of MonoBehaviour to gain the additional functionality.
